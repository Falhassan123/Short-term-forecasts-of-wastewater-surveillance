# Short-term-forecasts-of-wastewater-surveillance
This GitHub repository contains weekly real-time forecasts of SARS-COV-2 in the United States. We use an n-sub-epidemic modeling framework to produce forecasts each week.


#Model Specification and Forecasting
We conduct a 2-week forecast based on a 16-week calibration period. The Nonlinear Least Squares estimation method was utilized, with a Normal distribution applied for error modeling.
